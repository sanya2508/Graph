# Graph

 * Graph is a data structure that is like a network. (Non-Linear)
 * Applications:
    * Shortest Paths in Google Maps
    * Social Networking
    * Circuit Design
    * Routing Algorithms
    * Resolving Dependencies
    * Graphs in Deep Learning
    * Web Document (DOM Tree)
    * Image Processing and Segmentation

## Graphs Representation
  1. 2D Array (Adjacency Matrix)
     * Directed egde
     * Undirected edge (Bidirected edge)
     * Disadvantages:
        * Searching: O(n^2)
        * Neighbours: O(n)

     
  2. Edge List (Edges and Vertices)
  3. Adjacency List
     * Advantage:
        * Neighbours: O(neighbours) [Quite Fast]
        * Memory Efficient
        
  4. Implicit Graph



Maximum edges: NC2

Minimum edges: 0

Minimum edges(connected graph): (N-1)edges (tree)

## Adjacency List Representation
 * Array of list of size V
 * <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Graph/blob/master/adjacency%20list%20implementation%20for%20integer%20data.cpp">For integer data.
 * <a href="https://github.com/sanya2508/Graph/blob/master/adjacency%20list%20implementation%20for%20generic%20data.cpp">For generic data</a>
